2026-01-01: Implemented symbol blacklist to exclude invalid symbols (BCPB, etc.). Refined weights.json to favor ADX (2.0) and MACD (1.5) based on backtest performance. RSI disabled in baseline strategy.
2026-01-01: Verified and pruned invalid_symbols.txt. Found 97% of previously blacklisted symbols were actually valid. Reduced list to 5 confirmed invalid tickers. Updated SwingTrader to score version 1.4.
2026-01-02: Optimized Mean Reversion strategy by modularizing its scoring and disabling RSI (poison pill). Increased WR to 80% and Avg PnL to 0.40%. Updated weights.json and bumped score version to 1.5.
2026-01-02: Generated predictions for Friday, Jan 2, 2026 (based on 2025-12-31 data). Report saved to src/logs/report.txt.
2026-01-02: Upgraded SwingTrader price logic to use structural price action (EMA pullbacks, swing lows, and prior highs) instead of fixed ATR/percentage discounts.
2026-01-02: Implemented Reward-to-Risk (R:R) filtering. Candidates must now have a structural potential profit of at least 2x the potential risk to qualify.
2026-01-02: Added Volume Confirmation to entry logic. Bullish reversals must now have at least average volume (Relative Volume >= 1.0) to qualify for an 'at-close' entry; otherwise, they default to a limit order at the EMA 9.
2026-01-02: Implemented Multi-Timeframe Alignment. Candidates must now be in a primary Weekly uptrend (10-week EMA > 30-week EMA) to qualify for a long signal.
2026-01-02: Implemented Market Context Filter. The system now analyzes SPY and QQQ health before generating individual signals, acting as a 'circuit breaker' during bearish market regimes.
2026-01-02: Implemented Relative Strength (RS) Indexing. Baseline candidates are now rewarded or penalized based on their 3-month performance relative to the S&P 500 (SPY).
2026-01-02: Completed 6-month stress test for v1.5 strategies. Baseline: 54% WR, 1.7% Avg PnL (98% Cum). Mean Reversion: 29% WR, 0.4% Avg PnL (34% Cum). Baseline remains the primary strategy.
2026-01-02: Added auto-selection of the latest market date for the -p flag. If no date is provided, the system now automatically finds and analyzes the most recent historical data point.
2026-01-02: Implemented a 'Realism Filter' to discard signals where the targeted entry is more than 15% away from the close. This successfully pruned outlier candidates (RPT, SMX) caused by reverse splits or extreme parabolic moves.
2026-01-02: Divorced Mean Reversion from Baseline strategy. Implemented separate structural setups (Entry/Stop/Target) and relaxed Weekly Uptrend requirement for Mean Reversion.
2026-01-02: Re-enabled RSI for Mean Reversion strategy. Verified that the strategy 'divorce' alone doubled the MR win rate to 58% in December 2025 stress tests.
2026-01-03: Removed -it flag from all shell scripts (blueHorseshoe.sh, coverage.sh, pytest.sh) to ensure compatibility with cron jobs and other non-interactive environments. Added support for multiple arguments to blueHorseshoe.sh.
2026-01-03: Session summary: Divorced Mean Reversion from Baseline strategy, re-enabled RSI for MR (yielding 58% WR in backtests), fixed shell script cron compatibility, and manually verified Jan 2, 2026 data update.
