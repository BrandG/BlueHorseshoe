2026-01-01: Implemented symbol blacklist to exclude invalid symbols (BCPB, etc.). Refined weights.json to favor ADX (2.0) and MACD (1.5) based on backtest performance. RSI disabled in baseline strategy.
2026-01-01: Verified and pruned invalid_symbols.txt. Found 97% of previously blacklisted symbols were actually valid. Reduced list to 5 confirmed invalid tickers. Updated SwingTrader to score version 1.4.
2026-01-02: Optimized Mean Reversion strategy by modularizing its scoring and disabling RSI (poison pill). Increased WR to 80% and Avg PnL to 0.40%. Updated weights.json and bumped score version to 1.5.
2026-01-02: Generated predictions for Friday, Jan 2, 2026 (based on 2025-12-31 data). Report saved to src/logs/report.txt.
2026-01-02: Upgraded SwingTrader price logic to use structural price action (EMA pullbacks, swing lows, and prior highs) instead of fixed ATR/percentage discounts.
2026-01-02: Implemented Reward-to-Risk (R:R) filtering. Candidates must now have a structural potential profit of at least 2x the potential risk to qualify.
2026-01-02: Added Volume Confirmation to entry logic. Bullish reversals must now have at least average volume (Relative Volume >= 1.0) to qualify for an 'at-close' entry; otherwise, they default to a limit order at the EMA 9.
2026-01-02: Implemented Multi-Timeframe Alignment. Candidates must now be in a primary Weekly uptrend (10-week EMA > 30-week EMA) to qualify for a long signal.
2026-01-02: Implemented Market Context Filter. The system now analyzes SPY and QQQ health before generating individual signals, acting as a 'circuit breaker' during bearish market regimes.
2026-01-02: Implemented Relative Strength (RS) Indexing. Baseline candidates are now rewarded or penalized based on their 3-month performance relative to the S&P 500 (SPY).
2026-01-02: Completed 6-month stress test for v1.5 strategies. Baseline: 54% WR, 1.7% Avg PnL (98% Cum). Mean Reversion: 29% WR, 0.4% Avg PnL (34% Cum). Baseline remains the primary strategy.
2026-01-02: Added auto-selection of the latest market date for the -p flag. If no date is provided, the system now automatically finds and analyzes the most recent historical data point.
2026-01-02: Implemented a 'Realism Filter' to discard signals where the targeted entry is more than 15% away from the close. This successfully pruned outlier candidates (RPT, SMX) caused by reverse splits or extreme parabolic moves.
2026-01-02: Divorced Mean Reversion from Baseline strategy. Implemented separate structural setups (Entry/Stop/Target) and relaxed Weekly Uptrend requirement for Mean Reversion.
2026-01-02: Re-enabled RSI for Mean Reversion strategy. Verified that the strategy 'divorce' alone doubled the MR win rate to 58% in December 2025 stress tests.
2026-01-03: Removed -it flag from all shell scripts (blueHorseshoe.sh, coverage.sh, pytest.sh) to ensure compatibility with cron jobs and other non-interactive environments. Added support for multiple arguments to blueHorseshoe.sh.
2026-01-03: Session summary: Divorced Mean Reversion from Baseline strategy, re-enabled RSI for MR (yielding 58% WR in backtests), fixed shell script cron compatibility, and manually verified Jan 2, 2026 data update.

2026-01-04: Stabilized test suite. Fixed VolumeIndicator double-multiplication bug, updated SwingTrader tests for new strategy architecture, and aligned date/RR mocks. Entire suite (59 tests) now passing.
2026-01-04: Evaluated fundamental impact on strategy-specific success. Mean Reversion accuracy hit 78% using specialized models. Beta and Sentiment emerged as top drivers for MR.
2026-01-04: Implemented strategy-specific ML model loading in MLInference. The system now uses ml_overlay_baseline.joblib and ml_overlay_mean_reversion.joblib for more precise win probability filtering.

2026-01-05: Verified system stability (59 tests passed). Initiated full score rebuild and model retraining sequence (src/rebuild_and_train.sh).
2026-01-05: Added '-i' flag to main.py for intraday verification using yfinance. Updated Baseline strategy entry logic (relaxed EMA distance to 5%, volume to 0.9x) to better capture momentum. Validated prediction logic against Jan 5 live data (gap up resulted in no fills).
2026-01-06: Performed H2 2025 Stress Test. Baseline: 56.10% Win Rate, 0.86% Avg PnL (123 trades). Mean Reversion: 51.06% Win Rate, -0.20% Avg PnL (141 trades). Retrained stop loss model to resolve extreme multiplier issues.

2026-01-07: Updated Baseline strategy in strategy.py to enforce vol_ratio >= 1.0 and RSI <= 65 for immediate entries to filter out weak momentum and overextended setups.
2026-01-08: Continued historical data backfill. Executed multiple batches. Identified persistence of specific symbols (e.g., AACBR) in incomplete list despite processing.
2026-01-08: Implemented resumable backfill in historical_data.py using loader_checkpoints. Added --resume and --limit flags to main.py -b. Optimized check_data_completeness.py to skip symbols updated in the last 7 days, resolving the 'stuck symbols' issue for newer/limited-history tickers.
2026-01-08: Executed backfill batch of 200 symbols using --resume. Processed up to 'ALCYW'. Verified progress via checkpoint.
2026-01-08: Reset full_backfill_checkpoint to restart with correct 'full' outputsize.
