2026-01-10: Refactored ML feature extraction into `ml_utils.py` to eliminate code duplication. Fixed critical runtime bugs in `batch_loader.py` and `api.py`. Cleaned up linting errors (score 9.09/10).
2026-01-10: Ran Bear Market Backtest (Jan 3, 2022). Result: 0/6 profitable, Avg PnL: -6.10%. Top momentum signals (ONTO, AOSL, AMBA) saw double-digit drawdowns. Strategy is highly vulnerable to market regime changes.
2026-01-10: Ran Bull Market Backtest (Jan 3, 2024). Result: 8/10 profitable (80% Win Rate), Avg PnL: +0.09%. Strategy captures steady uptrends but gains were small. Confirms high sensitivity to market regime.
2026-01-10: Ran Chop Market Backtest (Jan 3, 2023). Result: 4/5 profitable (80% Win Rate), Avg PnL: +3.49%. Strong performance from BA and SHYF, but many high-scoring symbols resulted in 'no_entry', indicating entry logic might be too tight for volatile sideways markets.
2026-01-11: Resuming historical backfill from symbol 'DLS' with optimized rate (2s sleep). Cleared stale lock file.
2026-01-12: Performed extensive linting cleanup across core and data modules. Fixed unused imports, trailing whitespace, missing final newlines, and split long lines in symbols.py and service.py. Improved linting score to 8.97/10.
2026-01-13 17:16:46: Resolved all linting issues across the codebase. Refactored core, data, analysis, and utility scripts to reduce complexity (too-many-locals, too-many-branches, etc.) and achieved 10/10 Pylint rating for all modified files.
2026-01-13: Enhanced Bear Market Resilience. Improved MarketRegime with EMA 50/200 and Breadth checks. Implemented regime-based skipping for Momentum strategy. Tightened overextension penalties and enabled mandatory weekly uptrend for momentum signals. (Ref: todo.txt)
2026-01-13 (Session Shutdown): Verified stability (linting and all tests passed). Synced progress to documentation and committed changes.
2026-01-14: Performed Data Quality Audit (`check_data_completeness.py`). Identified 1,191 symbols with >50% price spikes, caused by unadjusted stock splits in raw data.
2026-01-22: Diagnosed severe system performance bottleneck. Load Average > 4.5 on 2 vCPUs caused by parallel execution of `run_isolated_indicator_test.py` (experiments) alongside the daily production pipeline. Daily report generation was delayed by >90 minutes.
2026-01-22 (Session Shutdown): Verified system stability despite load (Lint: 9.50/10, Tests: 59/59 Passed). Recommended upgrade to 4 vCPUs to handle concurrent production and research workloads.
