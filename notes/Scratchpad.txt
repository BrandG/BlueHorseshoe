Well, today I took the plunge (a little bit). I took the latest report, and bought $250 worth of the top-ranked stock. For posterity, that trade was
2.1 shares of KEX at $119. It's 1PM now, and it seems to be doing okay. If I walk away at the end of the day with a 1% win, I'll be happy.

I also added the Fibonacci Retracement calculation, so that's cool. I'm going to fix up the Ichimoku indicator next.

I had an idea earlier. Right now, I can choose what data to send to the prediction machine. If that's the case, then I should be able to send it an arbitrary
day's data, get the top ten list, and then check it against the answer given by the next day. If I do that, I can get a percentage of how many stocks
succeeded based on those indicators. Now, here's where it gets interesting. Let's say I do that with the last 40 days of data (2 months). Say I store the
"validity" of each day, and once I have the 40 "validity" scores, average them and say that the result is the effectiveness of my current indicators. After
that, I can apply weights to each of the indicators and run it again. By changing the weights and getting the effectiveness values of each weight, I should
be able to fine-tune the weights to fit reality. The cool thing is, I think that would take less than a day to run.

I want to alter the docker containers so that I can make scripts that call "update data", "debug", and "make predictions" functions callable from outside of
the container.

Okay, that was a lot harder than I expected. However, I now have the repository holding
the code necessary to make a mongo container and a BlueHorseshoe container. I need to test
it out at home, but for now, I'm getting back to indiators.

* Average Directional Index (ADX)
    +DI (Positive Directional Indicator) measures the strength of upward price movement.
    −DI (Negative Directional Indicator) measures the strength of downward price movement.

    Interpreting ADX Values:

    Below 20:
        Typically indicates a non-trending or weakly trending market. Price movement might 
        be choppy, sideways, or lack a clear directional bias.
    Around 20-25:
        Often considered a threshold. Once ADX rises above 20 or 25, it may signal the 
        beginning of a new trend or strengthening conditions.
    Above 25:
        Suggests a stronger, more established trend. The higher the ADX, the more dominant the trend.
    Above 50:
        Indicates a very strong trend, where prices are moving consistently in one direction.

* Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

    Interpretation of CCI Values:
        Between -100 and +100: This is the normal range, indicating that prices are near their average.
        Above +100: Signals that prices are significantly above their average, suggesting an overbought condition or a strong uptrend.
        Below -100: Signals that prices are significantly below their average, suggesting an oversold condition or a strong downtrend.

* Fibonacci Retracement
    Identify the Swing High and Swing Low:
        In an uptrend, the swing low is the lowest point before the trend starts rising, and the swing high is the peak.
        In a downtrend, the swing high is the highest point before the trend starts falling, and the swing low is the trough

So, I was thinking about how I recently had to rebuild my dev system,
after trying unsuccessfully to get it to autoload the mongo server.

I'm using enough libraries now (ta-lib, pymongo, requests, etc.) that I would really
benefit from having either a universally-runnable VM (which kills my online access, but
gets around all of the staging problems), or a docker container that I can move to
whatever source I need (specifically, a new codespace, or a new home computer).

For now, I want to work on getting a new Docker image set up. Rather, I would need
one image for the MongoDB server, and another for the actual python development.

What I'm thinking is, I should create a mongodb image in a new codespace, and once that's
working, export it to wherever. Then, create the new Python image and install the packages
needed. Next, get the code working on that image setup, and export it to wherever.
Then, copy the data over to the new location.

Okay, I've had mixed results from predictions so far, but I'm getting better at understanding it, so I'm starting over. 
I asked Claude.AI what the best indicators for day trading were, and this is the results.


For day trading, key technical indicators for stock predictability include:

1. Volume-Based Indicators
- Money Flow Index (MFI)
- On-Balance Volume (OBV)
- Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

2. Momentum Oscillators
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Stochastic Oscillator
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

3. Volatility Indicators
- Average True Range (ATR)
- Bollinger Bands
- Standard Deviation

4. Short-Term Trend Indicators
- 5/20 exponential moving averages
- Ichimoku Cloud
- Pivot Points

5. Liquidity Measures
- Bid-ask spread
- Trading volume consistency
- Intraday price range


I'm going to take those indicators over the next week, and start implementing them.
