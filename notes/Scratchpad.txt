Okay, that was a lot harder than I expected. However, I now have the repository holding
the code necessary to make a mongo container and a BlueHorseshoe container. I need to test
it out at home, but for now, I'm getting back to indiators.

* Average Directional Index (ADX)
    +DI (Positive Directional Indicator) measures the strength of upward price movement.
    −DI (Negative Directional Indicator) measures the strength of downward price movement.

    Interpreting ADX Values:

    Below 20:
        Typically indicates a non-trending or weakly trending market. Price movement might 
        be choppy, sideways, or lack a clear directional bias.
    Around 20-25:
        Often considered a threshold. Once ADX rises above 20 or 25, it may signal the 
        beginning of a new trend or strengthening conditions.
    Above 25:
        Suggests a stronger, more established trend. The higher the ADX, the more dominant the trend.
    Above 50:
        Indicates a very strong trend, where prices are moving consistently in one direction.

* Fibonacci Retracement

So, I was thinking about how I recently had to rebuild my dev system,
after trying unsuccessfully to get it to autoload the mongo server.

I'm using enough libraries now (ta-lib, pymongo, requests, etc.) that I would really
benefit from having either a universally-runnable VM (which kills my online access, but
gets around all of the staging problems), or a docker container that I can move to
whatever source I need (specifically, a new codespace, or a new home computer).

For now, I want to work on getting a new Docker image set up. Rather, I would need
one image for the MongoDB server, and another for the actual python development.

What I'm thinking is, I should create a mongodb image in a new codespace, and once that's
working, export it to wherever. Then, create the new Python image and install the packages
needed. Next, get the code working on that image setup, and export it to wherever.
Then, copy the data over to the new location.

Okay, I've had mixed results from predictions so far, but I'm getting better at understanding it, so I'm starting over. 
I asked Claude.AI what the best indicators for day trading were, and this is the results.


For day trading, key technical indicators for stock predictability include:

1. Volume-Based Indicators
- Money Flow Index (MFI)
- On-Balance Volume (OBV)
- Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

2. Momentum Oscillators
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Stochastic Oscillator
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

3. Volatility Indicators
- Average True Range (ATR)
- Bollinger Bands
- Standard Deviation

4. Short-Term Trend Indicators
- 5/20 exponential moving averages
- Ichimoku Cloud
- Pivot Points

5. Liquidity Measures
- Bid-ask spread
- Trading volume consistency
- Intraday price range


I'm going to take those indicators over the next week, and start implementing them.
