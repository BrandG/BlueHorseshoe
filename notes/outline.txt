allSymbols.txt is a list of symbols. It's got 7847 entries, so I'm guessing that's most of them.
getSymbolList.py reads a list of symbols from nasdaqtrader.com
getToday.py goes through the list of allSymbols.txt and grabs the latest data from yahoo.
mysql.py goes through the list of allSymbols.txt and puts the data from yahoo into a mysql table.
grabYears.py.bak has code for getting all the data from yahoo and puts it into a mongoDB table.
	inside this py file, it creates the error.txt file, which holds all the symbols that returned a null value.

data format
	ID (which could be assigned as a combination of all the other info)

II. Processing
	A. Grab a month
	B. Get Average Low (returns average Low value, as well as how often the low is that value or lower)
	C. Get Average High (returns average Hight value, as well as how often the hight is that value or high)
	D. Get Average Delta (average high-low, as well as how often the delta is greater than that)
	E. Get Midpoint Slope (get average slope as a distance from a given day's midpoint to the first day's midpoint. Return that and the total difference of each day's midpoint and the expected midpoint)
	F. Get Suggestion (receive monthData, avgDelta, midpointSlope, validators (how close these values stayed to their average), and return the expected high, low, and confidence)
	G. Get Final Suggestions (call getSuggestion for all the current symbols, and store the top 10 results)
III. Output
	A. Retrieve the top 10 results
	B. Create a web page that shows the results
	C. Create a PDF with the results
