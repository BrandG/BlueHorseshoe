**2. "Top Picks" Summary Cards (The Hero Section)**

* *Layout:* 3 large cards side-by-side for the top-rated stocks.
* *Data Mapping (from `Candidate` object in `service.py`):*

### View 2: The "Signal Detail" Modal

*Goal:* What happens when the user clicks on a row in the table. This replaces your static `report.txt`.

**1. The Chart (Left Column)**

* **Component:** An interactive candlestick chart.
* **Source:** Currently, you generate static PNGs in `report_generator.py`. For the wireframe, this would be a placeholder for a JavaScript charting library (like TradingView or Highcharts) that consumes your OHLCV JSON data.

**2. Trade Plan (Right Column)**

* **Header:** "Execution Setup"
* **Entry Zone:** Green box showing `entry_price`  0.5%.
* **Stop Loss:** Red text showing `stop_loss` (Source: `metadata['stop_loss']` from `strategy.py`).
* **Targets:**
* Target 1: `take_profit`
* Target 2: `take_profit` * 1.5



**3. The "Why?" Section (ML Explainability)**

* **Text:** "This signal passed the ML filter because..."
* **Data:** List the `components` dictionary (e.g., "RSI < 30", "Vol > Avg") that contributed to the score.
