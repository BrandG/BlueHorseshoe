Okay, I've had mixed results from predictions so far, but I'm getting better at understanding it, so I'm starting over. 
I asked Claude.AI what the best indicators for day trading were, and this is the results.


For day trading, key technical indicators for stock predictability include:

1. Volume-Based Indicators
- Money Flow Index (MFI)
- On-Balance Volume (OBV)
- Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

2. Momentum Oscillators
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Stochastic Oscillator
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

3. Volatility Indicators
- Average True Range (ATR)
- Bollinger Bands
- Standard Deviation

4. Short-Term Trend Indicators
- 5/20 exponential moving averages
- Ichimoku Cloud
- Pivot Points

5. Liquidity Measures
- Bid-ask spread
- Trading volume consistency
- Intraday price range


I'm going to take those indicators over the next week, and start implementing them.
