# ToDo: Indicator Analysis & Strategy Optimization

## Current State (v1.7)
- **ML Overlay v1.0:** 70% Accuracy model deployed. Predictive features dominated by Industry, Market Cap, and Beta.
- **Data Infrastructure:** Full backfill of Fundamental and News data for 6.7k symbols completed.

## Performance Baseline (H2 2025 Stress Test)
- **Baseline (Trend):** 54.39% Win Rate | 1.73% Avg PnL.
- **Mean Reversion (Dip):** 58.54% Win Rate (v1.6).

## Advanced Trading Architecture Improvements
- [x] **Strategy Divorce:** Separate logic for Trend-Following and Mean-Reversion.
- [x] **ML Overlay v1.0:** 70% Accuracy Random Forest model integrated into daily predictions.
- [x] **Fundamental Data Integration:** Added Sector, Industry, and Market Cap to features.
- [x] **News Sentiment Integration:** Added AlphaVantage news feed support.

## Future Ideas / Next Phase
- [ ] **Sentiment-Weighted ML:** Update the `prepare_training_data` to incorporate the News Sentiment score as a feature.
- [ ] **ML-Driven Stop Loss:** Train a regressor to predict the optimal stop-loss distance (ATR multiplier) for each symbol.
- [ ] **Trailing Stops:** Implement a 2.0 * ATR trailing stop for the `Backtester`.
- [ ] **Machine Learning Refinement:** Investigate why GLSI probability dropped with fundamental data (Overfitting vs. Regime shift).
- [ ] **Automated Retraining:** Script a weekly job to retrain the ML model on newly graded trades.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Implement Machine Learning Overlay.
- [x] Integrated News Sentiment and Fundamentals.
