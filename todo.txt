# ToDo: Indicator Analysis & Strategy Optimization

## Current State (v1.8)
- **Baseline Strategy:** Optimized with "Market Buy" entry for strong momentum; Dead/Flat stock filter added.
- **Mean Reversion:** Validated with recent historical tests (RDFN, PARAP).
- **ML Overlay v1.1:** 70% Accuracy model deployed.
- **Data Infrastructure:** Full backfill completed; Data Quality Audit pending.

## Performance Validation
- **Baseline (Trend):** Validated on historical dates (Dec 8 2025, Mar 19 2024). Market Buy logic captures runaway trends (YPF +11%).
- **Mean Reversion (Dip):** Strong performance on volatile assets (RDFN +23%).

## Active Tasks
- [x] **Entry Logic Optimization:** Baseline now defaults to Last Close entry for strong momentum signals.
- [x] **Dead Stock Filter:** Implemented volatility checks (ATR/StdDev) to reject pinned/buyout stocks.
- [x] **Historical Validation:** Verified strategy changes on random dates (Oct 2023, Mar 2024).
- [ ] **Data Quality Audit:** Scan the newly backfilled data for gaps, spikes, or anomalies.
- [ ] **Feature Engineering:** Re-run feature generation on the full historical dataset.
- [ ] **Deep Backtesting:** Run strategy simulations over 5-10 year periods.

## Future Ideas / Next Phase
- [ ] **ML Overlay v2.0:** Retrain models with deep history and new features.
- [ ] **Portfolio Optimization:** Implement Kelly Criterion or similar for sizing.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Implement Machine Learning Overlay.
- [x] Integrated News Sentiment and Fundamentals.
- [x] Implement a weekly automated retraining job.
- [x] Implement ML-Driven Stop Loss.
- [x] Implement Trailing Stops.
- [x] Implement Intraday Verification Mechanism.
- [x] Complete Full Historical Data Backfill.
