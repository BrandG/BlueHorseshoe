# ToDo: Indicator Analysis & Strategy Optimization

## Current State (v1.7)
- **ML Overlay v1.1:** 70% Accuracy model deployed. Predictive features dominated by Industry, Market Cap, and Beta.
- **ML Stop Loss v1.0:** Regressor implemented to predict volatility-adjusted drawdown (MAE).
- **Trailing Stops:** Implemented in Backtester (2.0 * ATR default).
- **Data Infrastructure:** Full backfill of Fundamental and News data for 6.7k symbols completed. Automated retraining implemented.

## Performance Baseline (H2 2025 Stress Test)
- **Baseline (Trend):** 54.39% Win Rate | 1.73% Avg PnL.
- **Mean Reversion (Dip):** 58.54% Win Rate (v1.6).

## Advanced Trading Architecture Improvements
- [x] **Strategy Divorce:** Separate logic for Trend-Following and Mean-Reversion.
- [x] **ML Overlay v1.1:** 70% Accuracy Random Forest model integrated into daily predictions.
- [x] **Fundamental Data Integration:** Added Sector, Industry, and Market Cap to features.
- [x] **News Sentiment Integration:** Added AlphaVantage news feed support.
- [x] **Automated Retraining:** Weekly job implemented in `src/cron_weekly_retrain.sh` and `maintenance.py`.
- [x] **ML-Driven Stop Loss:** Regressor predicts optimal ATR multiplier per symbol.
- [x] **Trailing Stops:** Implement a 2.0 * ATR trailing stop for the `Backtester`.
- [x] **Data Alignment:** Unified historical data into `historical_prices` collection and backfilled 2000+ symbols.
- [x] **Score Rebuild (Jan 2025):** Initiated background rebuild for training data generation.

## Future Ideas / Next Phase
- [ ] **Grading & Retraining:** Run `run_grading.py` and retrain ML models with Jan 2025 data.
- [ ] **H2 2025 Stress Test:** Perform 6-month simulation for both strategies with refreshed models.
- [ ] **Intraday Data Integration:** Pull 15-minute data for top candidates to optimize the entry window.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Implement Machine Learning Overlay.
- [x] Integrated News Sentiment and Fundamentals.
- [x] Implement a weekly automated retraining job.
- [x] Implement ML-Driven Stop Loss.
- [x] Implement Trailing Stops.
