# ToDo: Indicator Analysis & Strategy Optimization

## Current State (v1.9)
- **Codebase Health:** High (Lint score 9.09/10), Refactored ML Utils.
- **ML Overlay:** Feature extraction centralized; `ml_overlay.py` and `ml_stop_loss.py` streamlined.
- **Data Infrastructure:** Robust, with recent bug fixes in batch loading and API.

## Performance Validation
- **Baseline (Trend):** Validated on historical dates (Dec 8 2025, Mar 19 2024). Market Buy logic captures runaway trends (YPF +11%).
- **Mean Reversion (Dip):** Strong performance on volatile assets (RDFN +23%).

## Active Tasks
- [x] **Code Quality:** Refactored duplicate ML logic and fixed linting errors.
- [x] **Bug Fixes:** Resolved runtime errors in `batch_loader` and `api`.
- [ ] **Data Quality Audit:** Scan the newly backfilled data for gaps, spikes, or anomalies.
- [ ] **Feature Engineering:** Re-run feature generation on the full historical dataset using the new `ml_utils`.
- [ ] **Deep Backtesting:** Run strategy simulations over 5-10 year periods.

## Future Ideas / Next Phase
- [ ] **ML Overlay v2.0:** Retrain models with deep history and new features.
- [ ] **Portfolio Optimization:** Implement Kelly Criterion or similar for sizing.

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Implement Machine Learning Overlay.
- [x] Integrated News Sentiment and Fundamentals.
- [x] Implement a weekly automated retraining job.
- [x] Implement ML-Driven Stop Loss.
- [x] Implement Trailing Stops.
- [x] Implement Intraday Verification Mechanism.
- [x] Complete Full Historical Data Backfill.
